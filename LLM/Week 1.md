###### after setting up the environment for development and stuff
entering the anaconda prompt going to the projects root folder (llm engineering) and then activating the environment in which we'll work

`conda activate llms` 

- **Project Root Folder**: Keeps your files organized and ensures paths work correctly.
    
- **Environment (`llms`)**: Manages dependencies, isolates your project, and ensures consistency.

the environment setup ensures that there are no conflicts and such.

## jupyter lab
This is a Data Science playground where you can easily write code and investigate the results. It's an ideal environment for:

- Research & Development
- Prototyping
- Learning (that's us!)

It's not typically used for shipping production code, and in Week 8 we'll explore the bridge between Jupyter and python code.

A file in Jupyter Lab, like this one, is called aÂ **Notebook**.

A long time ago, Jupyter used to be called "IPython", and so the extensions of notebooks are ".ipynb" which stands for "IPython Notebook".
