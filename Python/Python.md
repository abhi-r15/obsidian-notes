####  *theres a different notes section for web scraping with python , these notes will only include stuff that is about python in general.
### some very very basic stuff if 

### data types
yada yada blah blah

###### concatenation done in the same way as js
`print("123" + "456")`
`123456`

*note - it will be added and the output will be 576 if double quotes aren't used

###### writing `print(123_234_345)` will get you the output `123234345`
**underscores are neglected by the interpreter 
##### subscripting
![[Pasted image 20250225004155.png]]

getting the index and printing out the value , in this case its "u" , we can also get the index vales as negative integers starting from -1 ---> *this indicates the last value ("h" in this case)
#### **typecasting

done through using functions that can typecast different data type to other type
as concatenation cant be done of the different data types

*helpful in this scenario 
eg.
`int("23")`
