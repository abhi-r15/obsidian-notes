*#off topic thonny ide btw is a great tool*
###### taking a random variable name and then the loop assigns each and every value of the sequence to that variable once and prints it

### extremely number friendly

built in function sum(iterable type , can be a sequence) = total sum of the elements
##### same with max( ) and min( ) functions that are there. 
we can use them or logically write out the code for them like i did-----

or just simply use the function

`largest = max(list)`

## the in range( ) function 
###### primarily used when the for loop is not working with a list , most of the cases basically

since in the range syntax
*for i in range(start , stop , step)*

the step part isnt changed dynamically everytime the loop runs we cannot use it in that way
