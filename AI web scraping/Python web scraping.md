##### everything starts with a web resources (an app or a site)
we give the server a request to get the resources and then parse the data in userful manner(we get gibberish ig).

## for the web server req stuff 
we'll use libs like - 
1. requests
2. httpx
3. playwright (browser for js heavy sites)

## for parsing and stuff 
1. beautifulsoup 
2. selectolax
(python libs the latter one being more modern and a bit faster).

### and then lastly we export the data in some readable format.

1. [[HTTP]]
2. [[html css js]]
